# CNN_Scratch
A CNN created from scratch using numpy only

I created this model while working on my thesis to help me build deep understanding of CNN.

This is also trained using degree 2 polynomial approximation of  ReLU for gathering weights and biases for my [Encrypted CNN](https://github.com/Arman001/CNN_Encrypted)

This is a very slow version as I used loops to perform convolution and pooling operation. But it can provide good understanding.
